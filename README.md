### 👋 About me

```yaml
name: "Satrajit Ghosh"
role: "MS ECE (Machine Learning) @ Rutgers University – New Brunswick"
gpa: "4.0 / 4.0"
interests:
  - real-time rendering & GPU scheduling
  - game engines & physics simulation
  - VR/AR training and immersive experiences
  - neural rendering & 3D vision
currently:
  - building: "LAGEngine (C++/OpenGL/CUDA engine + research testbed)"
  - exploring:
      - DAG-based render graphs
      - work-stealing schedulers
      - CUDA–OpenGL interop for real-time graphics
values:
  - "measure first, optimize second"
  - "systems that ship and can be profiled"
````

I’m a game developer and software engineer focused on **real-time graphics**, **GPU task scheduling**, and **VR/AR systems**.
Right now, most of my work happens inside **LAGEngine**, my custom C++/OpenGL/CUDA engine that doubles as a research platform for **multithreaded DAG scheduling**, **CUDA stream management**, and **GPU utilization**.

### 🎮 What I build

#### 🔹 LAGEngine – C++/OpenGL/CUDA engine + research testbed

* Custom **2D/3D game and physics engine** used as my master’s thesis platform.
* Implements a **DAG-aware render graph** with explicit render passes and resources.
* Uses **multithreaded scheduling** with work stealing and **CUDA–OpenGL interoperability** so GPU kernels can write directly into graphics buffers and textures.
* Instrumented for **frame timings, queue depths, synchronization and GPU utilization**, so I can actually measure the effect of scheduling policies instead of guessing.

> Repo: `LAGEngine` (C++ · OpenGL · CUDA · Graphics · AI-assisted scheduling)

#### 🔹 VR / AR systems

* **VR fitness/exercise game**
  Built a VR exercise game that won **3rd place** in the *Google & GeeksforGeeks “Solving for India”* competition – focused on **gamified workouts** with deep learning–based tracking.
* **VR warehouse training**
  Recreated an industrial warehouse in VR with **annotation and learning modules** for step-by-step training, built for a real corporate environment (e.g., Ericsson-style warehouse training).
* **VR house tours for architecture**
  Virtual tours for an architecture company so clients can “walk through” spaces before construction.
* **VR movie theatre experiences**
  VR environments and mini-games for entertainment during and after lockdown.
* This line of work led to **a VR-related publication** and multiple **hackathon wins** around immersive training and interaction.

#### 🔹 Neural rendering & 3D vision (Princeton exchange)

Through a competitive exchange program at **Princeton University**, I worked on:

* **Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)** – building photorealistic 3D scenes from multi-view images with volumetric rendering.
* **Gaussian Splatting** – experimenting with **real-time** point-based rendering for dynamic scenes.
* **Neural scene reconstruction & neural character generation** – pipelines for **animatable 3D avatars** from unstructured images, combining neural rendering and 3D reconstruction techniques.

#### 🔹 Quant-ish and tooling projects

When I’m not inside a graphics pipeline, I like building **tools around quantitative finance and automation**:

* small engines for **signal generation and backtesting**
* automation around **trading workflows** and **data analysis**
* practical scripts for personal finance and scenario modeling

### 📊 GitHub metrics (auto-updated)

> These cards are generated using **lowlighter/metrics** via GitHub Actions.([GitHub][1])
> Once you configure the action to output `github-metrics.svg`, this will render automatically.

<!--
You can add more variants (calendar, languages, activity, etc.) by generating additional SVGs with different plugin configurations.

Example extra cards (uncomment after you generate them):
